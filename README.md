# Fetal-health-multi-class-classification
Using Fetal Health Classification Dataset, I perform multi-class classification . Main part of the script consists in the analysis of the data, data mining and data engineering, and then Feature Engineering, dimensionality reduction and feature selection. Finally, we select the more accurate model.

Hard-code the path to the data (to be found at link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/cristianlapenta/fetal-health-classification-project) and run the project !

Comment and share any remarks or advices !
Best,
